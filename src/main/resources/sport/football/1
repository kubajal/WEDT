Vital goal for Dortmund
Benfica 2-0 Zenit St Petersburg / Borussia Dortmund 2-1 Slavia Prague

Benfica have scored again against Zenit St Petersburg to lead 2-0 in Lisbon. The Russians are down to 10 men following a second yellow card for Douglas Santos after he handled the ball in the 18-yard box, with Afonso Fernandes converting the resulting penalty.

As it stands in Group G, Zenit will be second, Benfica third and Lyon fourth. One goal for Lyon, who are currently 2-1 down at home to RB Leipzig, would change everything. Lyon would then go second, Benfica would stay third and Zenit would drop from second to fourth.

In Group F, Borussia Dortmund are now 2-1 ahead against Slavia Prague and Julian Brandt's goal leaves the Germans second as it stands.

They will drop to third if Inter get a winner against Barcelona, it's 1-1 in that one. Inter's Romelu Lukaku has just had an effort well saved by Barca goalkeeper Neto, while the Spaniards, already through, have just brought on Luis Suarez.
